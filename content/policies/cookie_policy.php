<h1>What Are Cookies</h1>
<p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are
    downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we
    use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from
    being stored; however, this may downgrade or ‘break’ certain site functionality elements.</p>
<p>For more general information on cookies, please read “What Are Cookies”.</p><br>
<h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
<p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard
    options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site.
    It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are
    used to provide a service that you use.</p><br>
<h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>
<p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser. Please see this awesome guide from
    Avast on how to do this if you are interested: How to Enable & Disable Cookies in Your Browser | Avast. Be aware
    that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling
    cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore it is

<h2>The Cookies We Set</h2>
<h3>Account related cookies</h3>
<p>If you create an account with us, we will use cookies to manage the signup process and general administration. These
    cookies will usually be deleted when you log out; however, in some cases, they may remain afterwards to remember
    your site preferences when logged out.</p>
<h3>Login related cookies</h3>
<p>We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having to log in
    every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure
    that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.</p>
<h3>Site preferences cookies</h3>
<p>In order to provide you with a great experience on this site, we provide the functionality to set your preferences
    for how this site runs when you use it. To remember your preferences, we need to set cookies so that this
    information can be called whenever you interact with a page affected by your preferences.</p><br>
<h2>More Information</h2>
<p>Hopefully, that has clarified things for you. As was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren’t sure
    whether you need or not it’s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the
    features you use on our site.</p>
